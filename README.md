Customer Churn Prediction is an end-to-end data analytics and machine learning project focused on identifying customers likely to discontinue a service using historical customer data. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature scaling, and feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), followed by training a Logistic Regression model for churn classification. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and key churn drivers are visualized to support business insights. The trained model is deployed using a Flask-based REST API that enables CSV-based predictions, demonstrating practical application of data analytics, machine learning, and software development principles to solve real-world customer retention problems.
